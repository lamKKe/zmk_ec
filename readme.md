# Tako zmk config

The first thing you should do after assembling the keyboard is to calibrate the matrix.

You should be able to access ZMK logs through the console. See [ZMK docs](https://zmk.dev/docs/development/usb-logging) for details.

Next, you should adjust actuation and release values for each key in the `config/tako_drivers/kscan/kscan_gpio_ec.c` file. Basically, actuation should happen at the tactile bump, but you can prefer different levels depending on your typing style. If the key actuates too early, then increase the value in the `actuation_threshold`. If it's too late, then decrease it. After this is done, you should change the `release_threshold` to reflect the actuation change â€“ reducing it by 50 should work great.

Don't map actuation levels too close to base reads (what you see in console when no touching keys).
